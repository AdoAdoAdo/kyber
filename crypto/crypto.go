/*
Package crypto provides cryptographic primitives needed by Dissent.
All cryptographic primitives are represented by abstract interfaces
designed to be independent of specific cryptographic algorithms,
to facilitate upgrading to new cryptographic algorithms
or switching to alternative algorithms for exprimentation purposes.
This package and its sub-packages also provide several specific
implementations of these abstract cryptographic interfaces.

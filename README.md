# onet

Overlay-network (onet) is a library for simulation and deployment of decentralized,
distributed protocols. It offers an abstraction for tree-based communications
between thousands of nodes and is used both in research for testing out new
protocols and running simulations, as well as in production to deploy those
protocols as a service in a distributed manner. A third part of the library
is used to write applications that contact the services on remote servers.

Onet is developed by [DEDIS/EFPL](http://dedis.epfl.ch) as part of the
[Cothority](https://github.com/dedis/cothority) project that aims to deploy
a large number of conodes for distributed signing and related projects.

The documentation for Onet is split into three parts:

- For users: have a look at the [Apps](https://github.com/dedis/cothority)
that have been written using Onet
- For PhD-students: if you want to start a project using Onet, have a look
at the [template](https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template)
- For developers: wanting to participate in the development of Onet? Then
go to our [wiki](https://github.com/dedis/onet/wiki)

## Contribution

If you want to contribute to Onet, please have a look at 
[CONTRIBUTION](https://github.com/dedis/onet/blobl/master/CONTRIBUTION) for
licensing details. Once you are OK with those, you can have a look at our
coding-guidelines in
[Coding](https://github.com/dedis/Coding). In short, we use the github-issues
to communicate and pull-requests to do code-review. Travis makes sure that
everything goes smoothly. And we'd like to have good code-coverage.

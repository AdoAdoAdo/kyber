On each participant, a verifier is indexed by the public key of the dealer and should receive
--> one verifier PER dealer
nOld
nNew
+ a deal from the given dealer in OldNodes 
    - verifier[dealer.index] 
    - oldN verifiers
+ a resp from each of the NEW nodes 
    - verifiers[dealer.Index]
    - there will be nNew * nOld such response

How to compute QUAL = # verifiers certified = # verifier which received nNew
response = all shares of a dealer should be verified

/*
Package simul allows for easy simulation on different platforms. THe following platforms
are available:

	- localhost - for up to 100 nodes
	- mininet - for up to 1'000 nodes
	- deterlab - for up to 50'000 nodes

Usually you start small, then work your way up to the full potential of your
protocol!
